Writeup and Reflection:

The runnable code is interactive.py. To play, move the cursor around the board with the arrow keys. When you get to a tile you want to color, use (g) for green, (b) for blue, (p) for purple, (y) for yellow, and (w) for white. When your art is done, press (m) to play the music. We definitely recommend only using one color at a time if you're going to play music.
